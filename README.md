# Classification Assignment for Machine Learning
In this first assignment of the Machine Learning Course from the Big Data Master we work in groups to analyze and fit some classification models to a given dataset.

The dataset provided is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains information about patients in a diabetes study. In particular, all patients are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Tasks:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identification and fitting process of classification models such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, SVM or Simple Neural Network.
- Comparative analysis of the fitted models
